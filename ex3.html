                Yeah
                Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
                You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
                Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
                I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah

                Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
                You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
                Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
                I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah

                I gave her everything
                She took my heart and left me lonely
                I think broken heart's contagious
                I won't fix, I'd rather weep

                I'm lost then I'm found
                But it's torture bein' in love
                I love when you're around
                But I fuckin' hate when you leave

                Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
                You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
                Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
                I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah

                Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
                You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
                Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
                I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah

                Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
                You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
                Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
